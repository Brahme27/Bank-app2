## üé® SCENARIO VARIATION STRATEGY

### Create Variations For:

**Customer Types**:
- Individual customer ‚Üí 15 test cases
- Corporate customer ‚Üí 15 test cases  
- Joint account ‚Üí 15 test cases

**Customer Categories** (each gets 15 test cases):
- Guarantor
- Joint owner
- Member
- Chairman
- Authorized signatory
- Secretary
- Trustee
- Guardian
- Director
- Owner
- Connected party
- Share holder public

**Product Types**:
- Standard account ‚Üí Full workflow
- Foreign currency account ‚Üí Full workflow
- Each product variation ‚Üí Full workflow

**Branch Types**:
- Home branch operations
- Non-home branch operations

**Result**: Base workflow (15 test cases) √ó Variations = Comprehensive coverage
