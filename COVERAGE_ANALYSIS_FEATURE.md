   Reason: UI customization, low testing priority
   ℹ️ Low priority - Consider coverage
```

### Recommendations
```
💡 Recommendations

Actions to Improve Coverage:

1. Address High Priority Gaps (3 items)
   - Review each high-priority missing requirement
   - Create test cases to cover these requirements

2. Review Partial Coverage (5 items)
   - Enhance test cases for partially covered requirements
   - Add more test scenarios

3. Re-generate Test Cases
   - Go back to "Upload & Generate" tab
   - Use "Focus Modules" to target missing areas
   - Increase test case count for better coverage
```

## 🔍 HOW THE AI ANALYSIS WORKS

### Step 1: Requirement Extraction
AI analyzes BRD text to identify:
- Functional requirements
- Features descriptions
- Business rules
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- System behaviors

### Step 2: Test Case Summarization
AI creates summary of test cases:
- Test case IDs
- Test conditions
- Module names
- Coverage areas

### Step 3: Mapping & Comparison
AI compares and maps:
- Which requirements have corresponding test cases
- Which test cases cover which requirements
- Coverage level (full vs partial)

### Step 4: Gap Analysis
AI identifies:
- Requirements without test cases
- Reasons for gaps
- Priority of missing coverage

### Step 5: Report Generation
AI generates structured JSON with:
- All covered requirements
- All missing requirements
- Coverage percentage
- Summary and recommendations

---

## 📊 COVERAGE METRICS EXPLAINED

### Coverage Percentage
```
Formula: (Covered Requirements / Total Requirements) × 100

Example:
30 covered requirements out of 40 total
= (30 / 40) × 100 = 75%
```

### Coverage Levels
- **Full Coverage**: Requirement has 2+ test cases covering different scenarios
- **Partial Coverage**: Requirement has 1 test case, may need more scenarios

### Priority Assignment
AI assigns priority based on:
- **High**: Core functionality, user-facing features, security, payment
- **Medium**: Secondary features, validations, integrations
- **Low**: UI preferences, optional features, edge cases

---

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### 1. Run Analysis After Generation ✅
```
Always run coverage analysis immediately after generating test cases
This ensures you catch gaps early
```

### 2. Target 80%+ Coverage ✅
```
Industry standard: 80-100% requirement coverage
Aim for at least 80% before test execution
```

### 3. Address High Priority Gaps First ✅
```
Priority order:
1. Fix all High priority gaps
2. Fix most Medium priority gaps
3. Fix Low priority gaps if time permits
```

### 4. Iterate and Improve ✅
```
Process:
1. Initial generation → 70% coverage
2. Add missing test cases → 85% coverage
3. Review partial coverage → 95% coverage
4. Final refinement → 100% coverage
```

### 5. Document Coverage ✅
```
Always download and save coverage reports:
- Include in test deliverables
- Share with stakeholders
- Track improvement over time
```

## 💰 COST ESTIMATION

### OpenAI API Cost for Coverage Analysis

**Per Analysis:**
- Input tokens: ~20,000 (BRD + Test Cases)
- Output tokens: ~3,000 (Coverage Report)
- **Cost**: ~$0.30 per analysis

**Recommended Usage:**
- Run once after initial generation
- Run again after adding test cases for gaps
- 2-3 analyses per BRD = ~$0.60-$0.90 total

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

### 1. Token Limits
- Analyzes first 100 test cases (token management)
- BRD limited to first 15,000 characters
- For large BRDs: split into modules and analyze separately

### 2. AI Interpretation
- AI interprets requirements based on BRD text
- May miss implicit requirements
- Review AI findings and adjust as needed

### 3. Accuracy
- Coverage analysis is AI-assisted, not perfect
- Manual review recommended for critical projects
- Use as guidance, not absolute truth

---

## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### 5-Minute Coverage Analysis
```
1. Upload BRD (Tab 1)
   ↓
2. Generate 50-80 test cases (Tab 1)
   ↓ (Wait 1-2 minutes)
3. Go to Coverage Analysis tab (Tab 3)
   ↓
4. Click "Analyze Coverage" button
   ↓ (Wait 30-60 seconds)
5. Review results:
   - Check coverage percentage
   - Review missing requirements
   - Download report
   ↓
6. Take action:
   - Go back to Tab 1
   - Focus on missing modules
   - Generate additional test cases
   ↓
7. Re-analyze to verify improvement
```

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "No requirements found"
**Solution**: Ensure BRD has clear requirement descriptions

### Issue: "Coverage analysis failed"
**Solution**: Check API key, reduce test case count, try again

### Issue: "All requirements marked as missing"
**Solution**: Test cases may not match BRD terminology, review manually

### Issue: "Too many requirements detected"
**Solution**: AI may be over-identifying, review and filter

---
