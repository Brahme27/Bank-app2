## CORE PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Workflow Decomposition Pattern (15-Step Model)**

Every complete business workflow is broken into approximately 15 sequential test cases:

```
Steps 1-5:   Data Entry & Validation (Field-level tests)
Steps 6-8:   Submission & Assignment (Maker activities)
Steps 9-11:  Authorization Queue & Approval (Checker activities)
Steps 12-14: Post-Authorization & Verification
Step 15:     Final Record Inquiry
```

**Application**: Apply this 15-step model to any transactional workflow in your BRD.

---

### 2. **Field Grouping Pattern**

Don't create one test case for all fields. Instead, group by form sections:

- **TC_001**: Account details section fields
- **TC_002**: Account relations section fields
- **TC_003**: Mode of operation section fields
- **TC_004**: Nominee details section fields

**Benefit**: Easier debugging and maintenance when issues occur in specific sections.

---

### 3. **Maker-Checker Authorization Pattern**

For ANY transaction requiring authorization:

**Maker Stage (3 test cases)**:
1. Submit transaction → Get reference number
2. Assign to authorizer → Sent for authorization message
3. Verify in queue → Transaction visible

**Checker Stage (3 test cases)**:
4. View authorization queue → Transaction listed
5. Explore details → Complete details displayed
6. Approve/Reject → Authorization success message

**Minimum 6 test cases** for every authorization workflow.

---

### 4. **Customer/Product Variation Multiplication**

**Formula**: Base Test Cases × Customer Types × Product Types

Example:
- Base workflow: 15 test cases
- Customer types: Individual, Corporate, Joint = 3 types
- Product types: Standard, Premium = 2 types
- **Total**: 15 × 3 × 2 = **90 test cases**

**Pattern Observed**: Each customer category (Guarantor, Director, Secretary, etc.) gets 15 full workflow test cases.

---

### 5. **Negative Test Case Pattern**

For each business rule, create one negative test case:

**Template**:
```
Test Condition: [Business rule name]
Description: To verify whether system allows [prohibited operation]
Expected: System shouldn't allow [prohibited operation]
```

**Examples**:
- Account holder as nominee → Should NOT allow
- Minor without guardian → Should NOT allow
- Single account with joint mandate → Should NOT allow

**Target**: Create negative test cases for 100% of business rules.

---

## TEST CASE FORMULA

### Formula for Calculating Required Test Cases

```
Total Test Cases = FV + WF + VAR + NEG + MOD + INQ

Where:
FV   = Field Validation (20% of total)
WF   = Workflow Tests (55% of total)
VAR  = Variations (multiply WF by variation factors)
NEG  = Negative Tests (10-15% of total)
MOD  = Modification Tests (5-10% of total)
INQ  = Inquiry/Reports (5% of total)
```

### Example Calculation for Account Opening:

```
Base Workflow: 15 test cases
Field Validation: 5 test cases
Variations: 3 customer types × 15 = 45 test cases
Negative Cases: 8 test cases
Modification: 5 test cases
Inquiry: 3 test cases
──────────────────────────────
TOTAL: 81 test cases
```

## STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS

### The 14-Column Framework (Mandatory)

| Column | Purpose | Key Point |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1-6 | Business Context | Links test to BRD requirements |
| 7-8 | Classification | Enables filtering and reporting |
| 9 | Identifier | Unique, sequential numbering |
| 10-11 | Module & Objective | Clear test purpose |
| 12 | Dependencies | Pre-requisite chain |
| 13 | Steps | Detailed, executable instructions |
| 14 | Validation | Specific, measurable outcome |

**Critical**: All 14 columns must be populated for every test case.

---

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS TO USE

### Test Condition Starters:
- "To verify the opening of..."
- "To verify the entry of..."
- "To verify the modification of..."
- "To view the..."
- "Authorize the..."

### Description Template:
```
To verify whether System allows the user to [action] [object]:
[List of items/fields/steps]
Click on [button].
```

### Expected Result Templates:
```
✓ Positive: "System should allow/display [specific outcome]"
✗ Negative: "System shouldn't allow [prohibited action]"
```

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Step 1: BRD Analysis (Day 1)

- List all screens and fields
- Identify business rules
- Map authorization requirements
- Count variations (customer types, products, etc.)

### Step 2: Test Case Planning (Day 1)
- Calculate test case count using formula
- Assign process IDs and scenario IDs
- Create test case numbering scheme
- Determine priorities

### Step 3: Field-Level Generation (Day 2)
- Create field validation test cases (20% of total)
- One test case per form section
- Add format and boundary test cases

### Step 4: Workflow Generation (Days 3-4)
- Create 15-step base workflows (55% of total)
- Add authorization test cases (6 per workflow)
- Link test cases via pre-requisites

### Step 5: Variation Generation (Day 5)
- Multiply base workflows by variations
- Customer types × Product types × Base workflow
- Maintain same structure for each variation

### Step 6: Negative & Other Tests (Day 6)
- Create negative test cases (10-15%)
- Add modification test cases (5-10%)
- Add inquiry/report test cases (5%)

### Step 7: Review & Refine (Day 7)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Correct Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Creating one test case with 50 fields | Break into 5 test cases with 10 fields each |
| Vague expected results: "It should work" | Specific results: "System should display success message with reference number" |
| Skipping authorization test cases | Always add 6 test cases for maker-checker workflows |
| No negative test cases | Minimum 10-15% should be negative scenarios |
| Missing pre-requisites | Every test case must have clear pre-requisites |
| Inconsistent terminology | Use same terms throughout (e.g., "CIF" not "Customer ID") |
| Generic descriptions | List specific fields and buttons to interact with |

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Measure Test Case Quality Using:

**Coverage Metrics**:
- Field coverage: (Fields tested / Total fields) × 100 = Target: >95%
- Workflow coverage: (Workflows tested / Total workflows) × 100 = Target: 100%
- Business rule coverage: (Rules tested / Total rules) × 100 = Target: 100%

**Quality Metrics**:
- Clear pre-requisites: Target: >95% of test cases
- Specific expected results: Target: >95% of test cases
- Negative test ratio: Target: 10-15%

**Execution Metrics**:
- Test case pass rate on first execution: Target: >80%
- Time to execute per test case: Target: <10 minutes
- Defect detection rate: Target: >90% of defects found

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Start with Templates**
Use the provided templates and patterns rather than starting from scratch.

### 2. **Maintain Consistency**
Once you establish naming conventions and structures, stick to them throughout.

### 3. **Think in Workflows**
Always break business processes into 15-step workflows for comprehensive coverage.

### 4. **Don't Skip Negatives**
Negative test cases catch the most critical defects. Target 10-15% minimum.

### 5. **Link Everything**
Use pre-requisites to create test case dependencies and execution order.

### 6. **Be Specific**
Vague test cases lead to inconsistent execution. List exact fields, buttons, and messages.

### 7. **Consider Variations**
Multiply base test cases by customer types, product types, and other variations.

### 8. **Authorization is Critical**
Banking and financial applications always need thorough authorization testing.
