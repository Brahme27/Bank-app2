# IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
## 7-Day Test Case Generation from BRD

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAY 1: BRD ANALYSIS
```
â–¡ Extract all business processes from BRD
â–¡ List all screens/forms with field counts
â–¡ Document all fields with properties (mandatory/optional, format, length)
â–¡ Extract all business rules and validations
â–¡ Identify transactions requiring authorization
â–¡ Calculate estimated test case count using formula
â–¡ Create test case numbering scheme (TC_001-TC_999)
â–¡ Set up Excel file with 14 columns

Formula: Total = (Screens Ã— 3) + (Workflows Ã— 15) Ã— Variations + Business Rules + Others
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAY 2: FIELD-LEVEL TEST CASES (20%)
```
â–¡ Create field validation template test case
â–¡ Generate 3 test cases per screen:
   â–¡ Mandatory fields entry
   â–¡ Optional fields entry
   â–¡ Field format validations
â–¡ Verify all fields from Day 1 analysis are covered
â–¡ Check test case IDs are sequential
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAYS 3-4: WORKFLOW TEST CASES (55%)
```
â–¡ Select first critical workflow
â–¡ Break workflow into 15 steps:
   Steps 1-5: Data Entry & Validation
   Steps 6-8: Submission & Maker Activities
   Steps 9-11: Authorization & Checker Activities
   Steps 12-15: Post-Authorization & Verification
â–¡ Write detailed test case for each step
â–¡ Link test cases via pre-requisites
â–¡ Add authorization test cases (6+ per workflow)
â–¡ Repeat for all workflows
â–¡ Verify workflow completeness
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAY 5: VARIATION TEST CASES
```
â–¡ List all variation dimensions:
   â–¡ Customer types (Individual, Corporate, Joint, etc.)
   â–¡ Product types (Standard, Premium, etc.)
   â–¡ Branch types (Home, Non-home)
   â–¡ User roles
â–¡ Create variation matrix
â–¡ Copy base workflow test cases
â–¡ Modify for each variation using Find & Replace
â–¡ Update variation-specific differences
â–¡ Verify all combinations covered
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAY 6: NEGATIVE & OTHER TEST CASES
```
â–¡ Create negative test cases (10-15%):
   â–¡ One test case per business rule
   â–¡ Invalid data entry scenarios
   â–¡ Access control violations
   â–¡ Boundary violations
â–¡ Create modification test cases (5-10%):
   â–¡ Modify data workflows
   â–¡ Update authorizations
â–¡ Create inquiry/report test cases (5%):
   â–¡ Search functionality
   â–¡ Report generation
   â–¡ Export functionality
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DAY 7: REVIEW & FINALIZATION
```
â–¡ Coverage verification:
   â–¡ Create traceability matrix (BRD â†’ Test Cases)
   â–¡ Verify all requirements covered (100%)
   â–¡ Verify all screens covered (100%)
   â–¡ Verify all workflows covered (100%)
   â–¡ Verify all business rules have negative tests
â–¡ Pre-requisite chain validation:
   â–¡ Check test execution sequence
   â–¡ Fix broken dependencies
â–¡ Quality checklist (sample 10%):
   â–¡ All 14 columns filled (100%)
   â–¡ Pre-requisites clear (>95%)
   â–¡ Expected results specific (>95%)
   â–¡ Negative test ratio (10-15%)
â–¡ Numbering check:
   â–¡ Sequential IDs with no gaps
â–¡ Create deliverables:
   â–¡ Test Cases Excel file
   â–¡ Test Summary Report
   â–¡ Traceability Matrix
   â–¡ Test Execution Sequence
   â–¡ Test Data Requirements
â–¡ Final review and sign-off
```
